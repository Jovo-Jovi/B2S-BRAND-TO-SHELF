# SESSION CONTEXT
Updated: 2026-08-02 · By: Opus · Phase: BUILD — P01 Foundation, in progress ·
Last task: P01-T02 · Verdict: pending

## Read these too
- `docs/method/PRECEDENTS.md` — binding rulings and environment quirks.
  MANDATORY every session.
- `docs/method/CARRY_FORWARDS.md` — the full carry-forward ledger. Open it
  when your task names a CF, when you land or amend rows, or at a gate.
- `DEVELOPMENT_JOURNAL.md` — append-only narrative history.

This file carries state and open ids only. Narrative belongs in the journal.
Keep it short: if a paragraph is growing here, it belongs elsewhere.

## Where we are
Gate 3 passed 2026-08-01 and the prepare phase is closed. Eight blocking
documents are frozen. Architecture is decided: `ARCHITECTURE.md` and twelve
append-only ADRs, signed by the owner — Next.js App Router on Vercel, Supabase
Postgres, row-level tenancy with default-deny RLS as the authorization boundary,
the privileged client physically quarantined, exact-decimal money end to end.
`BUILD_PHASES.md` sequences eight phases delivering Release 1; one branch per
phase per `BRANCHING.md`. P01 Foundation is in progress on `phase/01-foundation`
— no features: application shell, `DATA_MODEL.md` authored just-in-time, the
tenancy-spine schema with RLS on every table, generated types, and the nine CI
guards. P01-T01 landed the shell and three guards. P01-T02 landed `DATA_MODEL.md`
and `MODULE_SPEC.md`, **one** Supabase project under ADR-012, the Platform tier
applied to it — six tables plus the `role` enum, RLS on all six, 16 policies,
three helper functions, five §4 indexes, the active-owner trigger — the three
Supabase clients with the privileged one quarantined, generated types, and two
more guards with the drift job. Five of the nine §6 guards are live; four await
the phase that lands their target. **Tenant isolation is not yet proven: that is
T03, on this branch, before the phase gate.**

> Commit column: one or more comma-separated backticked shas, or `—` where no
> single commit tracks the step (P-00 through P-01c predate the one-task-one-commit
> convention). Several shas mean the step's deliverable, its PR-17 follow-up and,
> where the owner has merged it, the merge commit. The most recent row may read
> `pending` until its follow-up commit fills it (PR-17); `check_done_steps_shape.py`
> exempts the last row for exactly that reason.

## Frozen decisions in force
- Freeze point 2026-07-29 (`legacy/FREEZE.md`) — tools RETIRING, not port
  targets.
- Decision register: **79 decisions, all SIGNED, none open**, now
  authoritative at `docs/product/DECISIONS.md` (promoted P-05-LAND from
  `docs/method/B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` §2, which is annotated PROMOTED and
  retained as the signing record). §5 Release 1 SIGNED 2026-07-30.
- Reviewer direct repo read SIGNED 2026-07-31 — PR-09.
- Memory guard restructure SIGNED 2026-07-31 — this file, CF-55.
- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, `SCOPE.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 —
  P-05-LAND. `VOCABULARY_DRAFT.md` archived, superseded by `GLOSSARY.md`.
- `TENANCY_MODEL.md` and `SECURITY_MODEL.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 — P-06b-LAND.
  CF-31 closed against `SECURITY_MODEL.md` §4.
- `CALC_SPEC.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 — P-07-LAND. Calculation choices CS-01
  through CS-15 SIGNED 2026-08-01 by the owner (CS-15 signed separately by
  P-08-PRE, 2026-08-01).
- OD-H7 SIGNED 2026-08-01 — P-08-PRE. Gate 3 verifies the blocking set only
  (`PRODUCT_BRIEF`, `GLOSSARY`, `SCOPE`, `DECISIONS`, `DOMAIN_MODEL`,
  `TENANCY_MODEL`, `SECURITY_MODEL`, `CALC_SPEC`); the other thirteen frozen
  documents are just-in-time, each carrying its Gate 3 item to its own module
  gate. `CALC_SPEC.md`'s Gate 3 item covers its 25 Release 1 rows only.
  `DECISIONS.md` now carries 80 signed ODs, verified by count.
- PR-16 through PR-19 landed 2026-08-01. PR-18 and PR-19 exist because the
  reviewer's own state assertion went stale between verdict and execution.
- PR-20 landed 2026-08-01. Document hygiene batches into the next task touching
  the file and never earns its own round trip.
- Repository protections enabled 2026-08-01 (G3-CLOSE). Public, no required
  reviews, no PR gate; secret scanning, push protection, force-push block and
  deletion block on. Gate 3 item 11 evidence.
- `docs/method/BRANCHING.md` IN FORCE. One branch per phase, exit gate on the
  branch, one consolidated PR per phase, deletion only on verified containment.
- ADR-001 to ADR-011 SIGNED 2026-08-01. Append-only; superseded, never edited.
- ADR-012 SIGNED 2026-08-02 — P01-T02. **One** Supabase project, named for
  production: types generated from it, migrations applied to it, the isolation
  suite run against it. Supersedes ADR-006's two-environment clause only; the rest
  of ADR-006 stands. The organisation's plan allows two active projects and both
  slots were held, so the choice was one project or none. Reinstatement is CF-92
  and its trigger is a row count, not a judgement.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` precedence slot 11, `BUILD_PHASES.md` slot 13.
  `B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` is superseded as a plan; its §9 and §10 remain in force.

## Next action
P01-T02 done and pushed to `phase/01-foundation`, not merged: one Supabase project
under ADR-012, `supabase/schema.sql` split verbatim into seven migrations and
applied, six tables live with RLS and 16 policies read back from the catalog,
`lib/supabase/` with the privileged client quarantined behind `server-only`,
`types/database.ts` generated, and `check-service-import` · `check-data-boundary` ·
`types-drift` in the pipeline. Five of nine §6 guards live.

**T03 next, and it is the gate this task cannot be:** the isolation suite against
the live project — two seeded tenants, A reads exactly A's rows and zero of B's on
every table for select, insert, update and delete, the positive path asserted too,
no member raising their own `membership.role`, no cross-tenant `tenant_id` on
insert, `is_operator()` returning no business row. `DATA_MODEL.md` §5 is the
checklist and is not waivable by OD. Synthetic tenants carry the reserved slug
prefix and are torn down by the task that seeds them (ADR-012).

Two owner actions block the phase gate, both in CF-95: authorise the Vercel GitHub
App on the repository, and set `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`
as repository secrets. `types-drift` fails on every run until then, by design.
