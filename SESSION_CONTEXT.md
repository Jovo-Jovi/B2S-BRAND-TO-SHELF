## Where we are
Gate 3 passed 2026-08-01 and the prepare phase is closed. Eight blocking
documents are frozen. Architecture is decided: `ARCHITECTURE.md` and twelve
append-only ADRs, signed by the owner — Next.js App Router on Vercel, Supabase
Postgres, row-level tenancy with default-deny RLS as the authorization boundary,
the privileged client physically quarantined, exact-decimal money end to end.
`BUILD_PHASES.md` sequences eight phases delivering Release 1; one branch per
phase per `BRANCHING.md`. P01 Foundation is in progress on `phase/01-foundation`
— no features: application shell, `DATA_MODEL.md` authored just-in-time, the
tenancy-spine schema with RLS on every table, generated types, and the nine CI
guards. P01-T01 landed the shell and three guards. P01-T02 landed `DATA_MODEL.md`
and `MODULE_SPEC.md`, **one** Supabase project under ADR-012, the Platform tier
applied to it — six tables plus the `role` enum, RLS on all six, 16 policies,
three helper functions, five §4 indexes, the active-owner trigger — the three
Supabase clients with the privileged one quarantined, generated types, and two
more guards with the drift job. Five of the nine §6 guards are live; four await
the phase that lands their target. **Tenant isolation is now proven.** P01-T03
ran twenty-one assertions against the live catalog and the live policies —
DATA_MODEL §5's eight, five adversarial additions, four more the gate authored
itself, and a verified teardown. All PASS, none LOST. Two synthetic tenants were
seeded under ADR-012's reserved prefix and removed, with zero rows and zero
`auth.users` left behind, proven by query. The gate produced four findings, none
of them a breach of `SECURITY_MODEL.md` §1: CF-103, CF-104, CF-105 and CF-106.
P01-T04 closed all four and re-ran the whole gate: **31 assertions, 31 PASS, 0
FAIL, 0 LOST**, teardown verified at zero again. The schema now carries 18
policies and 6 functions. CF-103's exploit is closed — an owner invites, only
the invitee accepts — and its remaining half, the session-to-membership binding,
is retargeted to P02. Operator reach into tenant business data is behind a live
consent grant, logged, and cannot return `payload`. `SECURITY_MODEL.md` §1 has a
fourth guarantee, availability.

## Open carry-forwards — ids only
Full text in `docs/method/CARRY_FORWARDS.md`.

- CF-01 — Reinstate deferred Dev OS security/migration rule layer at P10 — owner: ARCHITECTURE.md, immediately after Gate 3 — the P10 it named does not exist in this plan
- CF-02 — Unescaped innerHTML in all legacy tools — owner: FEATURE_INVENTORY.md must-not-reproduce at P-07
- CF-03 — Legacy catch(e){} swallowing — owner: FEATURE_INVENTORY.md must-not-reproduce at P-07
- CF-05 — Print calibration unresolved until OD-5 signed — owner: PRINT_CONTRACT.md, authored just-in-time per OD-H7; the measurement is B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md Step 15
- CF-11 — REPORT.md §3.3 "design tools are independent islands" is FALSIFIED for the sticker tool — owner: the REPORT.md annotation task, before Gate 3
- CF-14 — Public repo: owner's given name and local folder path are permanently in git history — owner: RISK_REGISTER.md, authored just-in-time per OD-H7; its gate is the pre-relaunch audit, B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md §10
- CF-22 — Label-editor vs sticker-tool capability delta — owner: reviewer — verify closure against EXTRACT_DESIGN_TOOLS.md Part 2 at the TEMPLATE_MODEL.md authoring
- CF-32 — CSV import resequenced from void to post-DATA_MODEL feature — owner: IMPORT_SPEC.md, P-10
- CF-39 — `B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` §3/§4 now run together with no `---` separator — owner: reviewer, next light edit to `B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md`
- CF-41 — `B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` §1's product-definition table gives the wrong repo URL — owner: the write task that lands CF-39 — P-12
- CF-44 — VOID. Never issued; reviewer numbering error at the P-02 verdict — owner: none — void, retained as a numbering record. Exempt from the reachable-owner test by its VOID status
- CF-46 — EXTRACT_STOCK_COSTS.md §C.4 lists ten findings awaiting accept/reject — owner: reviewer — adjudicate the ten findings at the FEATURE_INVENTORY.md authoring, which is where accepted findings land
- CF-47 — Costing is last-purchase-price-wins by unconditional overwrite — owner: the R2 amendment to CALC_SPEC.md
- CF-50 — AUDIT_STICKER.md §3.4 names the three bb_color_presets seeds wrong — owner: the AUDIT_STICKER.md annotation task, before Gate 3
- CF-51 — Prompt-template defect: "one commit" collides with "do not amend or rewrite history" — owner: reviewer, standing
- CF-53 — `docs/method/PROJECT_RECONFIG.md` was byte-identical to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. The three-copy half is settled at P01-T04 — builder charter, pivot record, reviewer reference, each now naming its own role; what remains open is the lost reconfiguration record behind the STATUS stub — owner: reviewer, decide at P-12
- CF-54 — Stub count stated three ways — owner: reviewer, verify at Gate 3
- CF-56 — The falsified sticker preset names appear at two locations in AUDIT_STICKER.md — owner: the AUDIT_STICKER.md annotation task, before Gate 3 — same task as CF-50
- CF-58 — `tools/backup-browser-data.js` serves the abandoned browser-data backup workflow — owner: owner decision, retire or keep; landing at the next repo-maintenance task
- CF-60 — Four open rows carry no explicit `Owner:` field (CF-01, CF-05, CF-27, CF-44) — owner: reviewer, before Gate 3
- CF-69 — Invoice history is capped at 100 records with silent destruction — owner: FEATURE_INVENTORY.md must-not-reproduce
- CF-71 — A parse failure is indistinguishable from an empty collection, then saved over real data — owner: FEATURE_INVENTORY.md must-not-reproduce
- CF-72 — REPORT.md citations into the two business tools need re-derivation before use — owner: the REPORT.md annotation task, before Gate 3 — same task as CF-11
- CF-73 — bb-stock-costs.html:5645 ships a corrupted Arabic "full return" string on every printed report — owner: FEATURE_INVENTORY.md must-not-reproduce, UX_PRINCIPLES.md
- CF-74 — Report engine has no resource bundle outside the invoice template; two strings re-declared eight times — owner: DOMAIN_MODEL.md and UX_PRINCIPLES.md
- CF-75 — AGENTS.md and .cursor/rules/b2s-devos.mdc carried folder paths and a named library ahead of ARCHITECTURE.md; rewritten by P-05-PRE — owner: ARCHITECTURE.md, immediately after Gate 3
- CF-83 — Reviewer state assertions are not stamped to a commit — owner: PRECEDENTS.md, PR-18
- CF-84 — A verdict-logged carry-forward is opened as a stub, then re-opened as new by the next prompt — owner: PRECEDENTS.md, PR-19
- CF-92 — ADR-012's reinstatement trigger: the isolation suite may run against production only while it holds zero real tenants, and a staging project exists before the first one — owner: the task onboarding the first non-synthetic tenant, and the Phase 02 exit gate
- CF-93 — Seven specification gaps in DATA_MODEL.md's Platform tier, found by building it; none resolved by invention — owner: reviewer, at the next DATA_MODEL.md amendment
- CF-94 — `check-no-runtime-cdn` and `check-no-hardcoded-literals` scan `app/` and `proxy.ts` only, so `lib/` is unguarded — owner: the next task touching either guard, at the latest the Phase 02 entry checklist
- CF-95 — The deployment and drift pipeline is wired but not live. The `types-drift` secrets are now set (CF-108), so what remains open is the Vercel GitHub App authorisation and a green `types-drift` run to prove the fix — owner: the owner, before the Phase 01 exit gate
- CF-97 — The credential scanner fired on `process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, the safe form ADR-005 requires; the value side now rejects an environment indirection — owner: reviewer, to ratify the narrowing or reject it
- CF-98 — Four open Dependabot alerts on the default branch (3 high, 1 moderate; `postcss` ×3 and `sharp`, both transitive through Next.js), unrecorded since G3-CLOSE enabled alerts — owner: the owner, to authorise a dependency-bump task; at the latest the Phase 01 exit gate
- CF-99 — PR #2 (`main` ← `phase/01-foundation`) exists although P01-T02 forbade a pull request; opened by the owner's account, not the builder, and left untouched. Merging it before T03 lands the tenancy schema on `main` with tenant isolation unproven — owner: the owner, to leave it open until T03 and the phase gate pass, or close and re-open at the gate
- CF-103 — **Exploit closed at P01-T04 and re-tested as proof 19; the row stays open for the other half.** An owner may only invite and only the invitee may accept, enforced by a restrictive table-wide rule rather than a per-policy one. What remains is that `current_tenant_id()` returns null on more than one active membership, contradicting `DOMAIN_MODEL.md` §5.1, so a person who accepts a second invitation locks themselves out — owner retargeted: **P02, with authentication**
- CF-109 — The isolation suite is deliberately outside `npm test` and no CI job runs it. Originally forced by absent secrets, the decision now stands on ADR-012: one environment means a per-push job would seed and tear down against production on every commit. Consequence held consciously — a regression introduced between gates is not caught until the next gate — owner: CF-92's reinstatement trigger; when staging exists the suite becomes a required CI job on any schema-touching pull request

## Frozen decisions in force
- Freeze point 2026-07-29 (`legacy/FREEZE.md`) — tools RETIRING, not port
  targets.
- Decision register: **79 decisions, all SIGNED, none open**, now
  authoritative at `docs/product/DECISIONS.md` (promoted P-05-LAND from
  `docs/method/B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` §2, which is annotated PROMOTED and
  retained as the signing record). §5 Release 1 SIGNED 2026-07-30.
- Reviewer direct repo read SIGNED 2026-07-31 — PR-09.
- Memory guard restructure SIGNED 2026-07-31 — this file, CF-55.
- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, `SCOPE.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 —
  P-05-LAND. `VOCABULARY_DRAFT.md` archived, superseded by `GLOSSARY.md`.
- `TENANCY_MODEL.md` and `SECURITY_MODEL.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 — P-06b-LAND.
  CF-31 closed against `SECURITY_MODEL.md` §4.
- `CALC_SPEC.md` AUTHORED 2026-08-01 — P-07-LAND. Calculation choices CS-01
  through CS-15 SIGNED 2026-08-01 by the owner (CS-15 signed separately by
  P-08-PRE, 2026-08-01).
- OD-H7 SIGNED 2026-08-01 — P-08-PRE. Gate 3 verifies the blocking set only
  (`PRODUCT_BRIEF`, `GLOSSARY`, `SCOPE`, `DECISIONS`, `DOMAIN_MODEL`,
  `TENANCY_MODEL`, `SECURITY_MODEL`, `CALC_SPEC`); the other thirteen frozen
  documents are just-in-time, each carrying its Gate 3 item to its own module
  gate. `CALC_SPEC.md`'s Gate 3 item covers its 25 Release 1 rows only.
  `DECISIONS.md` now carries 80 signed ODs, verified by count.
- PR-16 through PR-19 landed 2026-08-01. PR-18 and PR-19 exist because the
  reviewer's own state assertion went stale between verdict and execution.
- PR-20 landed 2026-08-01. Document hygiene batches into the next task touching
  the file and never earns its own round trip.
- Repository protections enabled 2026-08-01 (G3-CLOSE). Public, no required
  reviews, no PR gate; secret scanning, push protection, force-push block and
  deletion block on. Gate 3 item 11 evidence.
- `docs/method/BRANCHING.md` IN FORCE. One branch per phase, exit gate on the
  branch, one consolidated PR per phase, deletion only on verified containment.
- ADR-001 to ADR-011 SIGNED 2026-08-01. Append-only; superseded, never edited.
- ADR-012 SIGNED 2026-08-02 — P01-T02. **One** Supabase project, named for
  production: types generated from it, migrations applied to it, the isolation
  suite run against it. Supersedes ADR-006's two-environment clause only; the rest
  of ADR-006 stands. The organisation's plan allows two active projects and both
  slots were held, so the choice was one project or none. Reinstatement is CF-92
  and its trigger is a row count, not a judgement.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` precedence slot 11, `BUILD_PHASES.md` slot 13.
  `B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md` is superseded as a plan; its §9 and §10 remain in force.
- PR-25 landed 2026-08-03 — P01-T03. Raising the version of a package already
  present, to close a published advisory, is maintenance and not a new
  dependency. It needs a task and a green pipeline, not an OD. This unblocks
  CF-98's four transitive advisories.
- **Tenant isolation PROVEN 2026-08-03 — P01-T03**, against `b2s-production`'s
  live catalog and live policies, at the commit that lands the suite. 21
  assertions, 21 PASS. **Re-proven at P01-T04 after the four findings were
  closed: 31 assertions, 31 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 LOST**, no prior assertion weakened
  and three restated to measure the property rather than a proxy for it (17, 18c,
  19). Re-run with `npm run test:isolation`; it is excluded from
  `npm test` because `ci.yml`'s `unit` job holds no Supabase secrets and a suite
  that skipped there would read as green. `SECURITY_MODEL.md` §4's re-run
  conditions apply: a new entity, any policy or grant change, a new privileged
  path, a role change, or any change to the operator surface re-runs the whole
  gate.

## Next action
P01-T04 done and pushed to `phase/01-foundation`, not merged. All four T03
findings are closed or amended, and the gate that found them passes again: 31
assertions, 31 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 LOST, teardown verified at zero rows and zero
`auth.users`.

**The T04 fix broke twice before it worked, and the reason is worth carrying.**
PostgreSQL applies a table's SELECT policies to an UPDATE twice — to the old row
and again to the new one — so an UPDATE policy alone can never make a write
reachable. The invitee's accept policy was written, applied and shipped-looking
before the suite showed it matching zero rows and reporting success. Recorded in
PRECEDENTS with the substitution method that diagnosed it. **Nothing here was
found by reading a migration; all three states were found by running the gate.**

**T05 next**, the Phase 01 exit gate, once the owner clears CF-95: authorise the
Vercel GitHub App and confirm `types-drift` runs green now that its secrets are
set (CF-108). Everything else in the phase's inbox is a reviewer call rather
than code — CF-93's seven specification gaps, CF-97's scanner narrowing, and
CF-98's four Dependabot advisories, which PR-25 now unblocks.

One owner action is new and small: the local shell runs Node 22 while `.nvmrc`,
`engines` and CI all say 24, so a local green is still evidence from a third
version. Recorded as residue on CF-106.

**PR #2 is still open and still must not be merged (CF-99)** until the phase gate
passes. Isolation is proven, which removes the sharpest reason to hold it, but
`BRANCHING.md` §3 wants one consolidated PR per phase at the exit gate, and `ci`
is still red at `types-drift` until CF-95's secrets are set. It is **not** a
draft and the T03 prompt's "do not un-draft" presumes it is — nothing was
un-drafted because there was nothing to un-draft, and CF-99 is amended with the
consequence: it is one click from merging, with no draft state in the way.
