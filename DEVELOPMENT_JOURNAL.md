Session summary: greenfield pivot confirmed — parity against the six retiring
legacy tools is void (OD B1 CLOSED), replaced by the four-standard acceptance
model in B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md §7. Repo renamed balance-bites-unified ->
B2S-BRAND-TO-SHELF on branch main (P-00, prior session). P-01 restructured the
tree into docs/requirements/, docs/requirements/extracts/, docs/archive/2026-07/
and docs/product/; archived stale/void method docs, RUNBOOK.md and the old
Claude Project Instructions; renamed BB_DEV_OS.md -> DEV_OS.md,
RETURNS_ADDENDUM.md -> RETURNS_REQUIREMENTS.md, and .cursor/rules/bb-*.mdc ->
b2s-*.mdc; landed VOCABULARY_DRAFT.md and the new CLAUDE_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md;
created 23 stub files. The decision register in B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md §2 holds
56 items — most SIGNED, four DELEGATED, and four (D10, E11, G10, G11) still
PROPOSED pending the owner's confirmation of §3's open items; "56 signed ODs"
in the P-01 prompt is therefore not yet exactly true of repo state and is
recorded here as reported, not silently corrected.

2026-07-30 | Standard | PREPARE Step 3 / P-01b (CF-36, CF-37 fixes) | docs/archive/2026-07/inventory.json, docs/archive/2026-07/README.md (new), docs/method/B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md, docs/method/PROJECT_RECONFIG.md (new), SESSION_CONTEXT.md | register's own row count (79) still does not match its "62" header line even after this fix — pre-existing discrepancy, flagged not corrected; Sec.3 "Still open - 4 items" now contradicts the updated Sec.2 and was left untouched (out of P-01b's stated scope); six new OD rows (C16-C19, E12, G12) use the literal fallback "SIGNED — see DECISIONS.md" because the actual reviewer-verdict resolution text was not supplied to this task | reviewer verdict on P-01b, then P-02

Session summary: P-01's reviewer verdict PASSED, closing CF-13, CF-25, CF-34,
CF-35, and crediting the 21-vs-23 stub-count discrepancy to the amendment's
own arithmetic rather than to execution. P-01b then closed CF-37 (reverted
the banner on inventory.json so it parses as valid JSON again, added an
archive-level README.md covering the directory instead) and CF-36 (signed
D10, E11, G10, G11, E2, E6, H1, H6 and added C16-C19/E12/G12 to
B2S_PREPARE_PHASE.md Sec.2, per the exact status changes specified — no
other section touched). Landed the untracked project-reconfiguration record
at docs/method/PROJECT_RECONFIG.md, content unchanged. All four commits
(three P-01, one P-01b) pushed to origin/main; remote confirmed to contain
docs/product/, docs/archive/, and docs/requirements/.
